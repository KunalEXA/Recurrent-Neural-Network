# Recurrent-Neural-Network
A simple recurrent neural network where each node receives input from that time step, and the output/state of the other node form the previous time step. Each
node has a bias. The goal is to learn w1; ^ w1; b1;w2; ^ w2; b2 from a given dataset using error Back Propagation Through Time.
The dataset format is [x1; x2; y1; y2].
